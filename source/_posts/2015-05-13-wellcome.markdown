Hi, this is my very first post in octopress ;) so it is a kind of hello world!

I need to probe several things about markdown syntax:

* lists
* code
* something else

``` java Java sample code
//This is some comment 
public String someSqlMethod(Integer id) {
	String query = "select column from table where id = :id";

	Object result = session.createSQLQuery(query)
		.addScalar("column")
		.setInteger("id", id)
		.uniqueResult();

	return (result !=null)?(String) result:null;
}
```

It looks like perfect!
